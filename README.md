# Generative-AI-with-Large-Language-Models by Deep Learning AI & AWS
- In this folder, [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) projects and notes can be found.
----------------------------------------
## WHAT  I LEARNED
------------------------
- Gain foundational knowledge, practical skills, and a functional understanding of how generative AI works
- Deeply understand generative AI, describing the key steps in a typical LLM-based generative AI lifecycle, from data gathering and model selection to performance evaluation and deployment
- Describe in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how theyâ€™re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases
- Use empirical scaling laws to optimize the model's objective function across dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements
- Apply state-of-the-art training, tuning, inference, tools, and deployment methods to maximize the performance of models within the specific constraints of your project 
- Discuss the challenges and opportunities that generative AI creates for businesses after hearing stories from industry researchers and practitioners
